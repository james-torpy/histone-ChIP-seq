Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 64 of /share/ScratchGeneral/jamtor/projects/hgsoc_repeats/histone-ChIP-seq/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/bwa/HGSOC_SAMN01761041/SRR600956-H3K4me3/SRR600956-H3K4me3.tmp
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job samtools_filter since they might be corrupted:
results/bwa/HGSOC_SAMN01761041/SRR600956-H3K4me3/SRR600956-H3K4me3.sorted.bam
Will exit after finishing currently running jobs.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
