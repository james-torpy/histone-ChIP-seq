MissingOutputException in line 52 of /share/ScratchGeneral/jamtor/projects/hgsoc_repeats/histone-ChIP-seq/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
raw_files/fastq/smtest/SRR600559-H3K27me3_pass.fastq.gz
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Will exit after finishing currently running jobs.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
